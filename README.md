# Bucket Finance

## Thanks for checking out Bucket Finance. This is my preferred method of tracking finances. If tracking every single coffee isn't for you, then check out Bucket Finance.

- Save money in 'buckets' for rainy days, vacations, or broken cars.
- Reconcile finances with your bank accounts on your schedule.

### Getting set up

To use the website, you'll need to create an account.

### Using the site: Creating Buckets

The current functionality allows you to create categories of expenses and deposits. We call the categories 'buckets.' Within each bucket, you can add expenses and deposits.

I'm currently working on a way to bridge the gap between your bank accounts and Bucket Finance. I'll update here when that's complete.

## About the API used
Data comes from the "exchangerate.host" API. Documentation can be found here: https://exchangerate.host/. This is rather useful if you're interestred in customizing the chart further.
If you use this component in your project, feel free to give them a shoutout!
